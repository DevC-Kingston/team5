## Inspiration
Here in Jamaica, you can ask anyone about the manner in which they usually go about finding any product they plan on purchasing and they will tell you the same thing, "I just check the closest store". This isn’t uncommon or unnatural, when considering Jamaica’s walking culture. With a tendency to visit multiple places to find the very product that they are searching for Jamaicans will often wander about. This is especially true in our own Jamaican farmer's market: "Town". But with the wake of the current global pandemic, we are forced to face the fact that we don’t have the ability to freely move about, as we previously could; as we now have to adapt to a brand-new lifestyle. Being aware of the current societal climate, “Luk Fi It” was developed. The bot that is associated with “Luk Fi It” is our own way of reducing face to face interaction with each other and to reduce the usual head traffic that is associated with it.


## What it does
Luk Fi It : was proposed to reduce the number of places that we visit, by locating a particular product for the user and providing them the location of all stores that carry that item.
