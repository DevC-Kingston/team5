## Inspiration
Here in Jamaica, you can ask anyone about the manner in which they usually go about finding any product they plan on purchasing and they will tell you the same thing, "I just check the closest store". This isn’t uncommon or unnatural, when considering Jamaica’s walking culture. With a tendency to visit multiple places to find the very product that they are searching for Jamaicans will often wander about. This is especially true in our own Jamaican farmer's market: "Town". But with the wake of the current global pandemic, we are forced to face the fact that we don’t have the ability to freely move about, as we previously could; as we now have to adapt to a brand-new lifestyle. Being aware of the current societal climate, “Luk Fi It” was developed. The bot that is associated with “Luk Fi It” is our own way of reducing face to face interaction with each other and to reduce the usual head traffic that is associated with it.


## What it does
Luk Fi It : was proposed to reduce the number of places that we visit, by locating a particular product for the user and providing them the location of all stores that carry that item.


## List your Chatbot’s features and use cases
1. **Looking for items** - We link people with product from the comfort of home 
2. **Display** : We give details on the product and the location of the item if they wish to pickup


## How we built it
Tech Stack & Documentation:
*Chatbot - We created a chatbot for Facebook messenger with node.js and firebase to host the database and integrated Wit.ai to aid with NLP. This was done while utilizing the Facebook GraphAPI to communicate to users on a facebook page.


## Challenges we ran into
1. While linking the google cloud platform to allow the user to parse user uploaded images using the vision API there was an issue in with possibly the image compression resulting in the images being too low qality when to be analyzed when tested.

2. Linking the database of choice "firebase" to our chatbot so we could pool the inventory from the different vendors that would be registered with us and run the queries that would pull the item the user is looking for this also resulted in issue with viewing the address. 
 
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We are proud of joining our first project to the bootcamp for the first time. We have no experience before and we learned as we went along, we have combined all our individual traits and knowledge areas to come together to develop this using some of the most recent and advanced software development tools, services, and frameworks out there to create a platform with an impact in to.



## What we learned
* Be patient and that with perserverance we can over come any errors during code
* We have learned about the complexity in databasing. We have done research on how to effectively use databases as well as Messenger API to improve or bot's functionality.



## What's next for “Luk fi it”
Product Roadmap - next features for example
1. Iteration for getting product-market fit
2. Allowing users to use audio input to purchase items through the chatbot 
3. Adding an OCR to allow users to take pictures of their shopping lists


## Built With - provide the tech stack used 
* Node.js
* Firebase
